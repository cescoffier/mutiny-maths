## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. 
Open an issue directly in [GitHub](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/issues).

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.
Don't forget to indicate your SmallRye Mutiny, Java, and Maven/Gradle version. 

## Before you contribute

To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests, from your **own** fork.

### Code reviews

All non-trivial contributions, including contributions by project members, need to be reviewed before being merged.

### Continuous Integration

Because we are all humans, the project uses a continuous integration approach and each pull request triggers a full build.
Please make sure to monitor the output of the build and act accordingly.

Mutiny uses GitHub Actions as CI, so you can see the progress and results in the _checks_ tab of your pull request.
Follow the results on https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/actions.

### Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests. 
Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation, javadoc...).

We even accept pull requests just containing tests or documentation.

## The small print

This project is an open source project, please act responsibly, be nice, polite and enjoy!
